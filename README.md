## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Dangerous Curvature Detection project! This project aims to detect dangerous curvatures in various objects, such as roads, tracks, or pipes, using computer vision techniques. The detection of dangerous curvatures can be crucial in many applications, including autonomous vehicles, industrial safety, and infrastructure inspection.

This repository contains the code for the Dangerous Curvature Detection project, which is designed to run on Google Colab. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to identify hazardous curvatures accurately.

## 2. Project Overview

- **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project comprises images of objects with and without dangerous curvatures. The data was collected from various sources and manually labeled for training and testing purposes.

- **Preprocessing**: The collected data undergoes preprocessing to remove noise, resize images, and augment the dataset for improved model generalization.

- **Model Training**: The core of the project is the CNN model, which is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the patterns of dangerous curvatures.

- **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance and accuracy.

- **Inference**: The final trained model can be used for inference on new images to detect dangerous curvatures.

## 3. Installation

To run the Dangerous Curvature Detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/dangerous-curvature-detection.git
   cd dangerous-curvature-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 4. Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Upload your dataset to Google Colab.

2. Open the `dangerous_curvature_detection.ipynb` notebook on Google Colab.

3. Set up the notebook environment by running the necessary cells.

4. Modify the notebook as needed, adjusting hyperparameters or model architecture if required.

5. Train the model on your dataset by executing the corresponding cells in the notebook.

6. Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.

7. Save the trained model for future inference.

## 5. Dataset

The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can prepare your dataset containing images with dangerous curvatures and images without dangerous curvatures. The dataset should be organized in separate folders for each class.

## 6. Model

The model architecture used for Dangerous Curvature Detection is a pre-trained CNN, such as ResNet or VGG, with additional custom layers for fine-tuning. The specific model architecture and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the `dangerous_curvature_detection.ipynb` notebook to achieve better results for your dataset.

## 7. Results

As of the current state, the Dangerous Curvature Detection project is still a work in progress, and the final results have not been achieved yet. We are actively working on training and fine-tuning the model to detect dangerous curvatures accurately.
Our team is continually exploring various architectures and optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance on the dataset. We are committed to delivering a robust and reliable solution for detecting dangerous curvatures in images.
Stay tuned for future updates as we make progress on the project. We appreciate your interest and support in this endeavor.
